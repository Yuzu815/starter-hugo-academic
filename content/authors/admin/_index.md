I am a fourth-year student at Guangdong University of Finance & Economics, majoring in computer science and technology. For the past year and a half, I have been a member of a vulnerability identification research lab under the guidance of Lec. Yinhao Xiao, trying to participate in scientific research, improve my research skills and find the research direction that interests me. Currently, my interests lie in distributed storage, federated learning and privacy computing.
